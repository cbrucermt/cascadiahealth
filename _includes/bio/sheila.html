<p>Hello, my name is Sheila. I have been practicing Physiotherapy for over 25 years and am still learning every day. In 1989, I graduated with a degree in Physical Education. I continued my education, pursuing a career in Physiotherapy, graduating in 1993. I began my work with athletes in a wide variety of sports and competitive levels, from recreational to professional. While I loved the work, I was also sure there was more to healing and wellness. I began studying Zero Balancing in the late 1990â€™s, became certified as a practitioner and a teacher, joining the Zero Balancing Faculty in 2004. Zero Balancing is a powerful body-mind therapy that uses skilled touch to address the relationship between energy and the structures of the body to promote wellness and healing. ZB affects the whole person, mind, body and spirit.</p>

<p>In practice, I combine manual therapy techniques with exercise and complementary therapies. These include zero balancing, cranio-sacral, and myo-fascial techniques, to address the individual needs of the client. Treatment includes the whole person to facilitate healing and wellness. I continue to teach Zero Balancing classes.</p>
