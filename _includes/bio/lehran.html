<p>Lehran studied TCM and Acupuncture at Pacific Rim College. She has worked with a diverse clientele, delivering a wide range of treatments. Special interests include but not limited to: balancing the mind-body connection, fertility and reproduction, treating insomnia, and functional movement. Lehran offers an empathetic and gentle approach to her practice and focuses on personal wellness. Whatever your symptoms, she will work with you to alleviate and treat the underlying cause, enabling you to thrive on your journey to balanced health.</p>
<p>When not in the clinic sheâ€™s usually out riding her bike, studying, playing with animals or friends, and enjoying nature. Lehran looks forward to seeing you at the clinic!</p>
