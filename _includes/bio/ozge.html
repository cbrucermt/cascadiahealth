<p>Hello! My name is Ozge. I am a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Acupuncturist*, with a background in Sociology. It is my intention to contribute to my community through sustainable and holistic healthcare.</p>
<p>I genuinely believe that everyone has the potential to achieve wellness and balance in life, and it is my privilege to offer Acupuncture to support you on this quest. I also utilize other TCM modalities during my treatments, such as cupping and gua sha. In addition, I provide Chinese Food Therapy and lifestyle counseling, to encourage integration of treatments in your everyday life.</p>
<p>In my practice, I treat a wide range of acute and chronic concerns, including but not limited to: insomnia, anxiety, musculoskeletal conditions, menstrual irregularities, depression, headaches, pre and postnatal care, menopause, and digestive complaints.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about my services and how Acupuncture can benefit you, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to meeting you and being a part of your journey!</p>
