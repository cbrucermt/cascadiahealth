<p>Hello!  My name is Rebecca and, for as long as I can remember, keeping active and helping others has been something of high importance in my life.  I believe that taking care of your body will allow you to live your life to the fullest and enjoy all that life has to offer.  My interests range from athletic performance to rehabilitation and general overall well being.  I recently completed the 2200 hours Registered Massage Therapy Program at the West Coast College of Massage Therapy, where I developed and fine-tuned my skills as a therapist.  During treatments, I include movement, focused breath work, deep tissue work, myofascial release and Swedish relaxation techniques. I would love to work with you to develop a treatment plan to create a strong foundation for a healthy, well-balanced life.  In my spare time, you can find me coaching and participating in CrossFit, hiking and exploring the island, enjoying some coffee, cookies and a good game of crib.  I cannot wait to meet you!
