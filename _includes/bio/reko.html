<p>Reko graduated from the College for Massage Therapy in December 2021. Prior to training to become an RMT, he learned and practiced Bio-Dynamic Breathwork for several years, a system that uses breath to help release tension in the body. There he learned how the breath and therapeutic touch can be used to create great mental, emotional and physiological change. This led him to expanding his practice in the realm of massage, where he now uses his knowledge to support patients in finding a sense of alignment.</p>
