<p>Hi, my name is Colleen and I graduated from the West Coast College of Massage Therapy’s 3000hr program in December of 2009.</p>
<p>As a Registered Massage Therapist, I work with all sorts of clients including those with repetitive, overuse injuries, recreational and competitive athletes looking to optimize recovery and performance, people with neurological disorders, and those that just need to unwind and reduce some stress at the end of a long week. Depending on the needs of my clients, I will incorporate a combination of AIS (Active Isolated Stretching), IASTM, (Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization), Swedish, deep tissue, trigger point, myofascial release, isolytic release, passive and active movements and muscle energy techniques into my treatments. I’m a great listener and strive to really understand what is happening with each client. Pressure is always client-dependent and can range from light to deep, depending on client preference and desired treatment outcome.</p>
<p>When I’m not in the clinic, I love hanging out and going for walks with my awesome pup, doing Crossfit and, of course, travelling as much of the world as I can. I look forward to working with you and, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me.</p>
