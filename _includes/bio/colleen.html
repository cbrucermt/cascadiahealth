<p>Hi, my name is Colleen and I graduated from the West Coast College of Massage Therapy in Victoria, BC. in December of 2009.</p>
<p>As a massage therapist, I've worked with all sorts of active clients - weekend warriors, golfers, weight lifters and triathletes. I've always enjoyed an active lifestyle -swimming, biking, hiking and Crossfit, which helps me relate to a lot of the needs of my clients. My volunteer experience with the MS Society has also given me great insight into the many benefits of therapeutic exercise and movement patterns during rehabilitation and the promotion of healthy function.</p>
<p>In my treatments, I offer a wide range of techniques including trigger point therapy, muscle energy, myofascial release, Active Isolated Stretching (AIS), Swedish and deep tissue massage. Pressure is always done to your preference and needs. I also have special pregnancy cushions that will enable you to lie face down in total comfort at any stage of your pregnancy.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m always accepting new clients and look forward to working with you! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!!</p>
