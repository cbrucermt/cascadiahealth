<p>Hello, my name is Kiana. I graduated from the West Coast College of Massage Therapy in Victoria, B.C. in August of 2018</p>
<p>Over the years, I have been involved in many sports and activities such as soccer, volleyball, running, and Crossfit. These have not only helped to give me an interest and understanding of body movement and recovery, but also lead to my interest in becoming a massage therapist. Although I love being active, I also recognize the importance of downtime and relaxation, and enjoy being able to bring this rest and relaxation to my clients to help promote a more balanced lifestyle.</p>
<p>As a therapist, I enjoy working with all types of clients, creating individualized treatment plans for each person. My sessions might include such techniques as myofascial manipulation, active or passive stretching, trigger point therapy, and/or Swedish massage for relaxation as well as deep tissue.</p>
<p>Whether you are battling an injury, sore from life or just looking to relax, I would love to help!</p>
<p>If you have any questions about my services, please do not hesitate to ask. I look forward to working with you.</p>
