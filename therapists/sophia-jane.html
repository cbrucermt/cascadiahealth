          <p>Sophia graduated from Sutherland-Chan in Toronto in 2017. She has since worked at clinics in Toronto and BC- in the lower mainland and the Shuswap. She is a recent transplant in Victoria and is enjoying exploring the area and getting to know the community.</p>
          <p>Sophia's treatment style involves treatment from a bio-psycho-social perspective (considering the whole person). The foundation of her treatment perspective is working with the nervous system to cultivate a feeling of safety, deep relaxation and rest, as it is, in her experience, from this place that our bodies tend to heal most effectively. Sophia is continuously learning more about pain science and evidence based practice as an ever evolving field to apply to practice.</p>
          <p>Sophia uses a variety of techniques, but tends to treat slowly, using general Swedish techniques, rhythmic movements and compressions, working with the breath and the nervous system of each individual she is working with.</p>
          <p>She enjoys working with patients to reduce feelings of pain and improve movement and general feelings of wellbeing.</p>
