          <p>I was born in Beijing and grew up in an environment deeply rooted in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). From a young age, my parents envisioned me becoming a TCM doctor. The aroma of Chinese herbs and the rows of drawers at local pharmacy always fascinated me, carrying an air of mystery. My mother, an extraordinary woman, played a significant role in shaping my connection to TCM. Whenever I fell ill, she would heal me with her magical cooking. This profound upbringing, along with her influence, inspired me to pursue TCM after earning two bachelor’s degrees—one in China and in Canada. I later obtained my diploma as a Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner (TCMP) from Pacific Rim College.</p>
          <p>I am deeply passionate about acupuncture and dedicated to sharing my knowledge to help others achieve optimal health. I respect each individual’s unique healing journey and am committed to providing personalized care to support my patients. I value TCM’s holistic approach, which considers both external and internal factors in illness, using Yin-Yang theory to restore balance within the body. The wisdom of ancient TCM classics continues to inspire me, and I strive to integrate this timeless knowledge into my practice.</p>
          <p>Before becoming an acupuncturist, I owned a Pilates studio, where I helped clients manage
            pain, recover from injuries, and reduce stress through movement. I have experience treating a
            wide range of conditions, including chronic pain, depression, insomnia, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), arthritis, and more. I believe in the power of combining acupuncture with other TCM modalities, such as cupping, gua sha, moxibustion, diet therapy, exercise, and herbal medicine, to create a comprehensive and effective healing approach.</p>
          <p>Outside of my practice, I enjoy spending time in nature, playing with my kitties, and practicing
            Tai Chi, Qigong, and other mind-body movements. I also find joy in watching the clouds, the
            ocean, and thought-provoking movies.</p>
