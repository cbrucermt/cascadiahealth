          <p>Noah provides a warm space for patients to be heard and to heal, while placing importance on patients' understanding of acupuncture treatments and encouraging participation in their own healing process. Along with other health issues, Noah often treats acute and chronic pain, children and moms, digestive and genito-urinary disorders, and emotional health.</p>
          <p>Noah's passion for acupuncture began twenty years ago with experiencing its therapeutic successes first hand while studying in Asia. He returned to live in China and studied Mandarin, Chinese massage, and qigong. Later he completed graduate studies in human geography, researching environmental health in indigenous communities in southwest China, and went on to study Chinese medicine and acupuncture at Pacific Rim College here in Victoria. He remains amazed by the ways that different understandings of people and place support deeper insights into medicine and health, and feels honoured to have the opportunity to help you and your health. Currently practicing in James Bay and Fernwood, he's excited to join Cascadia Massage and Health Centre and practice close to home. </p>
          <p>Outside the clinic, Noah loves raising a family, growing lots of food, and exploring the wild. Please feel free to contact him with any questions or concerns.</p>
