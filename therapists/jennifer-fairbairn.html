          <p>Jennifer is a Registered Acupuncturist passionate about assisting people on their health journey. She was first introduced to acupuncture after struggling with amenorrhea and anxiety as a result of emotional stress. After seeing firsthand the systemic effect acupuncture had on both the mind and body, Jennifer packed up her car and drove across Canada with her Golden-Doodle, Cooper, to study Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p>
          <p>Before earning her Diploma of Acupuncture at Pacific Rim College in Victoria, BC, Jennifer lived in Indonesia and Oman for nearly five years. While there, she obtained her yoga teacher training certificate and deepened her love for cooking by starting a food blog, Reaching For Greens, where she posted plant-strong meals. Upon returning to Canada, Jennifer graduated as the Valedictorian from the Applied Holistic Nutrition program at The Institute of Holistic Nutrition in Toronto, Ontario.</p>
          <p>As a practitioner, she has a particular interest in cosmetic acupuncture, pain conditions, gastrointestinal-digestive disorders, and mental-emotional health. Jennifer continues to regularly attend workshops and online courses to further her education.</p>
          <p>When not in clinic, you can find Jennifer gardening, exploring new recipes in the kitchen, or out on a hike with her pup!</p>
