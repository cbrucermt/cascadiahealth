          <p>Mirella is an east coast transplant who moved to British Columbia for her traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) studies, and is now happily living in Victoria. She first started her Chinese medicine studies at Kootenay Columbia College of Integrative Health Sciences (formerly ACOS) in Nelson and finished at Pacific Rim College with a R.TCMP diploma. With a science background from her undergraduate degree she has always had an interest in biology and medicine that made her curious about the long-standing and holistic practice of treating people through Chinese medicine.</p>
          <p>She loves treating all kinds of cases and has a special interest in learning more about dermatology, auto-immune diseases and chronic conditions among other things. Continuously on the quest for learning new techniques and modalities, she likes integrating the different tools in Chinese medicine like gua sha, cupping, moxibustion, tuina, diet and lifestyle recommendations into her treatments.</p>
          <p>She recently completed her training in Mei Zen facial acupuncture with Dr.Martha Lucas, in addition to having previously learnt the Acusculpt method from Illya Borreson, and will be bringing in facial acupuncture treatment sessions to her schedule soon.</p>
          <p>On her own time she loves doing outdoor activities, checking out consignment stores, animal watching and enjoying sunny days at the beach.</p>
